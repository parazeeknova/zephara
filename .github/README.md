#### _<div align="left"><sub>// Local Development</sub></div>_
Zephara uses convex for its db, real-time updates, and authentication. To run the project locally, you need to set up a convex project and install the required dependencies.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/parazeeknova/zephara.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd zephara

# Install the required dependencies
bun install # or bun i

# Set up the convex project (You'll need to create a convex account if you don't have one)
# You can create a convex account at https://www.convex.dev & put your convex creds in .env file
# Check the .env.example file for the required environment variables
# Then run the following command to start the convex backend server: 
bunx convex dev # This will start the convex dev server

# The next step is optional but recommended. It sets up the auth provider for the app.
# For proper Authentication, you need to set up the auth provider. You can do this by running the following command:
# More details for this can be found at: https://labs.convex.dev/auth/config/oauth/github
# To set up the auth provider, you need to create a GitHub OAuth app and get the client ID and secret. 
bunx convex env set AUTH_GITHUB_ID <your_github_id> # (optional)
bunx convex env set AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET <your_github_secret> # (optional)
# Same for the Google OAuth app:
bunx convex env set AUTH_GOOGLE_ID <your_google_id> # (optional)
bunx convex env set AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET <your_google_secret> # (optional)

# Start the development server finally
# This will start the zephara dev server
bun run dev
```
